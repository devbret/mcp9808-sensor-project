# MCP9808 Sensor Project

![Visualization of the average temperatures for every minute from a twenty four hour period.](https://hosting.photobucket.com/bbcfb0d4-be20-44a0-94dc-65bff8947cf2/083a8baa-9cbe-4435-9a2b-825bd9222ec2.jpg)

## About

Code for combining a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH computer with an Adafruit MCP9808 temperature sensor. The files in this repo are related to [the following Hackaday.io project](https://hackaday.io/project/202152-enviropi-temp-monitor).

## Instructions

1. Upload the Python file to a RPi Zero 2 WH via SSH and run it.

2. When exiting your terminal session, use Screen to keep the Python file operating.

3. Allow your computer/sensor device to capture data for as long as desired.

4. Export your data from the Raspberry Pi computer, onto your main computer.

5. Visualize it using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript provided.

## Please Note

In my experience, the Python file will generate between three and four megabytes of data every twenty four hours.
